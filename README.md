# SVT-38 ‚Äî The First Step Toward Firepower

Recovered from the corrupted schematics of a derelict orbital survey vessel, the **SVT-38** is a semi-automatic battle rifle born in the uneasy days before Old Earth fell to silence.

Originally developed by the Soviet Union in the late 1930s, the SVT-38 (Samozaryadnaya Vintovka Tokareva) was designed to bring faster, longer-ranged fire to the infantry ‚Äî a bold step forward from bolt-action doctrine. Chambered in the powerful 7.62√ó54mmR cartridge, it offered range and repeat fire in a sleek frame. But it was complex, fragile, and ultimately short-lived.

Centuries later, Rimworld settlers uncovered a damaged blueprint buried in the memory of a shattered survey drone. Rebuilt from scavenged parts and a stubborn will to survive, the SVT-38 fires once more ‚Äî flawed, powerful, and steeped in forgotten legacy.

*A fragile step. A powerful echo. A relic reborn.*
